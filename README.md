Scripts to remove an inbox rule

v02 is an interactive "menu" based script allowing script runner to load e-mail address(es) and inbox rule(s) name into it and query for the rule's exsistence and ability to delete the rule.

v01 is much more simpler version that simply asks for e-mail address and inbox rule name, then deletes the rule.
